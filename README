Overview:

Pivotal Tracker (http://pivotaltracker.com) is an awesome tool for managin backlogs on agile projects.  The one thing it sucks at is going large-print.  If you're in a conference room doing iteration planning, when you zoom in on the browser, the page doesn't scale well.  This Chrome extension fixes that, by:

(1) Preventing the div containing the backlog from overflowing/scrolling horizontally
(2) Disabling the top nav, control panel when zoomed in.

Installing:

(1) Download the *.user.js file
(2) Drag-and-drop it onto your chrome window
(3) Go use http://pivotaltracker.com/
(4) Zoom in (Ctrl++) a few times
(5) Enjoy
