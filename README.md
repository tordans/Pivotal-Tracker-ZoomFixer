# Overview:

Pivotal Tracker (http://pivotaltracker.com) is an awesome tool for managin backlogs on agile projects.  The one thing it sucks at is going large-print.  If you're in a conference room doing iteration planning, when you zoom in on the browser, the page doesn't scale well.  This Chrome extension fixes that, by:

1. Preventing the div containing the backlog from overflowing/scrolling horizontally
2. Disabling the top nav, control panel when zoomed in.

# Installing:

1. Download the *.user.js file
2. Drag-and-drop it onto your chrome window
3. Go use http://pivotaltracker.com/
4. Zoom in (Ctrl++) a few times
5. Enjoy
